Biologically informed deep learning for explainable epigenetic clocks

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started




### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marakeby/pnet_prostate_paper.git
   ```
2. Create conda environment
   ```sh
   conda env create --name pnet_env --file=environment.yml
   ```
3. Based on your use, you may need to download one or more of the following

   a. [Data files](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17nssbdUylkyQY1ebtxsIw5UzTAd0zxWb&export=download) (needed to retrain
   models and generate figures). Extract the files under ```_database``` directory. If you like to store it somewhere
   else, you may need to set the ```DATA_PATH``` variable in ```config_path.py``` accordingly.

   b. [Log files](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18dJ5fWvJyISROkLRCUMfhsrwZ_iNXSNP&export=download) (needed to
   regenerate paper figures). Extract the files under ```_logs``` directory. If you like to store it somewhere else, you
   may need to set the ```LOG_PATH``` variable in ```config_path.py``` accordingly.

   c. [Plots files](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DiZB8qvZqVXs9HyDCF7bCFOr_T1ER7Ku&export=download) (a copy of the
   paper images). Extract the files under ```_plots``` directory. If you like to store it somewhere else, you may need
   to set the ```PLOTS_PATH``` variable in ```config_path.py``` accordingly.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. Activate the created conda environment
   ```sh
   source activate pnet_env
   ```
2. Add the current diretory to PYTHONPATH, e.g.

   ```sh
   export PYTHONPATH=~/pnet_prostate_paper:$PYTHONPATH
   ```

3. To generate all paper figures, run
     ```sh
   cd ./analysis
   python run_it_all.py
   ```

4. To generate individual paper figure run the different files under the 'analysis' directory, e.g.
     ```sh
   cd ./analysis
   python figure_1_d_auc_prc.py
   ```
   For ```Figure3``` , make sure you run ```prepare_data.py``` before running other files
5. To re-train a model from scratch run
   ```sh
   cd ./train
   python run_me.py
   ```
   This will run an experiment 'pnet/onsplit_average_reg_10_tanh_large_testing' which trains a P-NET model on a
   training-testing data split of Armenia et al data set and compare it to a simple logistic regression model. The
   results of the experiment will be stored under ```_logs```in a directory with the same name as the experiment.  
   To run another experiment, you may uncomment one of the lines in the run_me.py to run the corresponding experiment.
   Note that some models especially cross validation experiments may be time consuming.
